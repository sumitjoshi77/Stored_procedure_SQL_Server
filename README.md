# Stored_procedure_SQL_Server
A stored procedure is a prepared SQL code that you can save so that the code can be reused repeatedly. 
So if you have an SQL query that you write over and over again, save it as a stored procedure, and then call it to execute it.
You can also pass parameters to a stored procedure so that the stored procedure can act based on the parameter value(s) that is passed.

Stored Procedure Syntax:

CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name
AS
sql_statement
GO;
